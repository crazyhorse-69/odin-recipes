# Odin Recipes

This is the first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations course.  
It is a simple website that displays recipes using only HTML.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a basic multi-page website. Each page contains a recipe with titles, paragraphs, lists, and images. This is designed to strengthen foundational HTML knowledge.

## ðŸ§  Skills Demonstrated

By the end of this project, I will have practiced and demonstrated:

- Writing semantic HTML structure
- Creating and linking multiple pages
- Using headings, paragraphs, lists, and images
- Organizing files and folders
- Using Git and GitHub for version control

This is my first step into building web projects from scratch. Itâ€™s a great way to apply what Iâ€™ve learned and get comfortable using Git with real files.
